A team member is not showing up to meetings
Planning
Arrange a consistent time to meet that works for everyone
Monitoring
Have one member manage a log of who shows up to each meeting
Valid reasons could be health issues, going on vacation etc. but should be communicated properly and a solution should be formed as soon as possible, such as rescheduling or being willing to move the call online.
Escalation
Missing two meetings without a valid reason and not being willing to reschedule
Was it known at the start of the project
Only if it is a scheduled vacation, otherwise it is a potential risk

Team members have different skills and capabilities
Planning
Discuss everyone's skills and weaknesses
Monitoring
If one member is struggling with a task, they should work on it with another team member who is skilled in that area so that they can learn or if that isn’t possible for whatever reason, swap tasks with someone else to do something more in their skillset
Escalation
If a team member doesn’t have the skills to do any tasks even after getting help from the other team members after a couple weeks into the project then the teaching team should be informed
Was it known at the start of the project
If the discussion at the start goes according to plan then most skills and weaknesses should be known, but there will probably be some that aren’t known and that is a potential risk

All team members contributing and showing up to meetings is important to the success of the project. To ensure that everyone shows up to the meetings, we would plan consistent times to meet, ideally once or twice a week. These would be at times that work for everyone, potentially straight after lectures or labs. In the planning stage, we would also select the team leader to be in charge of keeping a log of everyone who shows up to the meetings. This will help with monitoring and act as proof of absence if escalation is necessary. A team member missing a meeting is fine as long as they have a valid reason, health issues, vacation etc. but should be properly communicated and a solution should be formed as quickly as possible. Some possible solutions could be rescheduling or calling instead of meeting in person. In general, most reasons for skipping a meeting (other than vacations) will not be known in advance, so this is only a potential risk. We decided that missing two meetings without a valid reason and not being willing to reschedule is cause for escalation and the teaching team should be informed that there is an issue.

One great aspect of working in a team is getting to learn from each other's skills and capabilities. If handled poorly however, this can also lead to issues, since everyone has their own weaknesses too. For the planning stage, the team should all discuss what they are good at and what they think are their weaknesses. This will help the team to know what each person may need help with. After this discussion, most skills and weaknesses should be known, but there will probably be some that aren’t mentioned or known and that is a potential risk. During the project, if a team member is struggling to complete a task, they should work together with someone more skilled in that area to complete it. This will ensure that the task gets completed and that the team is able to share their knowledge with each other. If for some reason this isn’t possible, then the task should be swapped to someone else so that it gets done. If a team member doesn’t have the skills to do any tasks a couple weeks into the project, even after getting help from the other team members, then the teaching team should be informed.
